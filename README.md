#stock-portfolio-predictions
A simple Python script that gives you the best, worst, and latest stock portfolio performace over a given frame of time.

This assumes you have equally invested your assets into each stock you give for your portfolio. Uses Yahoo! Finance as a historical stock data source.

You can use this tool to mix and match different portfolio options and quickly analyze its historical and latest performance. This also produces a text file (`out.txt`) with the performance for every time frame up to the present.

##Notes
Note that these numbers will not correspond exactly to what you would see on the Yahoo! Finance website since this uses adjusted stock prices to compensate for splits/mergers/etc.

This might crash if you use really shady stocks (eg if they haven't been on the market long) or some penny stocks since there's not enough data to crunch numbers.
